## FAQ

### Why make this ?
I wanted a mod manager, named toolbox because it will be more than just a mod manager, it's not strictly just for Manor Lords, there will be implementation for it to work with other games built with Unreal Engine.

### Why primarily Kotlin not C# or C++ or JS ?
Ergonomics, for me it's the most comfortable to work with at night.

### Will this app stay relevant after mod support is out ?
Yes, even more.

### Does this project accept contribution ?
Yes, I'm not as experienced as you might expect, there will be plenty of open issue from me and others and you will be properly credited
